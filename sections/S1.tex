Your paper must be anonymous (no identifying information should appear in the PDF file).  If it is not, it will automatically receive a 20\% deduction, and will be graded by a grumpy staff member.

The paper must be no more than 6 pages long in a font no smaller than 10 point. It should include whatever tables, graphs, plots, etc., are necessary to demonstrate your work and conclusions. It should not include code.

Use of this particular template is not required, as long as you follow the guidelines above (e.g., you may choose to use an existing template from a machine learning conference).
